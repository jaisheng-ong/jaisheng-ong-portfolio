In this project, I made a basic portfolio website for myself and transformed it into an interactive, visually appealing. 

Key improvements include:
- Adding a responsive dark/light theme toggle with persistent preference storage
- Creating interactive education and skills sections with clickable bubbles that reveal detailed modal windows
- Enhancing the projects section with technology icons that display tooltips on hover
- Implementing responsive design elements for various screen sizes
- Adding professional styling with consistent color themes, animations, and visual feedback
- Integrating social media links with icon-based navigation
- Structuring content in a clear, professional manner that highlights your technical skills and academic achievements
